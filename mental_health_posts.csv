1jti7u2,2025-04-07T10:41:21,depression,"I do not want live anymore. I think a combination of circumstances and bad people make me not want to live anymore. 



I rent the second apartment/room in my life. 



The first landlord a businessman in his 50s, perpetually busy, after time it turned out that he drank alcohol in amounts exceeding any norm, and in addition, he chewed psychoactive subtsances. 

After two years, when he went into debt in his main business, he demanded a one-time 220% raise, which I was to pay within 2 days. 

Since raises of this amount are illegal under Polish law I refused, he began to threaten me with beatings and death. 



I moved out immediately out of fear for my life. 

Because such a quick turnaround worsened my health ( I suffer from RA) I got acute sciatica, and to this day, that is, in 3 months I cannot recover. 



The second accommodation was an apartment from a woman in her 40s, who on first contact seemed nice, friendly and cordial. 

The problem turned out to be that now at the beginning of April the cooperative turned off the heating, and in my locality, and when I asked the owner if she could ask if they would turn on the heating, she laughingly said that well I have a peshka and if I do not like it I know where the door is and I can move out. 

I will mention that the heating period in my country ends at the end of April. It turned out that it was a heating malfunction and it has already been restored, but the distaste remains.

The second story is that I rent a room for financial reasons and the roommates are the next horror story. 



In the first apartment there were five rooms. In one next to me lived a boy who got up around 6pm, cooked around 2/3am and all day we had to keep quiet so as not to wake him up because otherwise there were arguments. 

In the other room next to me lived a couple, who in turn talked passionately and loudly all night. 

In the next one a woman and her daughter moved in, and in a while her partner, who scattered beer cans everywhere and argued about anything ( the color of other tenants' laundry could put him in a bad mood). In the last room lived an elderly lady with her mother about 90 years old, who listened to TV so loudly that I in the other end of the apartment with headphones and music could hear every word. 

With the tenant, who talked loudly at night with her boyfriend - I couldn't get along completely - at the same time her two sons - my age - died, she told me that my life was worthless and I should die instead of them. She forbade me to leave the room at certain times so that I would not spoil her mood, and when I did in spite of this it almost came to hand-to-hand.

There was no heating in the apartment, I had to buy it at my own expense, most of the time to shower and wash in the washing machine we had to go to the neighbors.



In the second apartment I have only one roommate, an alcoholic. He drinks about 1 liter of vodka a day. At first we chatted a little, casually, he encouraged me to exchange ideas and discussions after which he stated that I was stupid and laughed at everything I said. 

We both have an entrance to the terrace from our rooms. Since he smokes a lot and goes out several times an hour to smoke, even at night he wakes up from sleep and goes out about once an hour, the door in his room from the terrace quickly broke down, he demanded that he could smoke at my place. I objected because I wasn't comfortable with having someone hanging around in the evenings or at night when I'm sleeping, resting or talking to someone on the tel and want privacy, and still without asking ( he's not in the habit of knocking).  



These 2.5 years on rentals have completely destroyed me. From a cheerful, sociable girl, eager to help others, even volunteering, I became fearful, distrustful, petulant. I cried several times a day.





I do not have the opportunity to take out a mortgage, as a result of illness and financial problems I had slips in cash installments and no one will give me a mortgage. 

I won't get an apartment from the city because my income exceeds the financial criterion by several hundred zlotys. 

I don't have the health or money to move now, much less to rent something just for myself. 



The first landlord demanded that I pay a deposit and for the first month in cash, and not only that, he doesn't want to give me the deposit back, but also threatens me with the courts. 



In the second apartment the neighbors I have also some not happy. One apartment is occupied by a married couple with two children. When I initially came and greeted my wife banged on me that she was not interested in chatting. 

In the next apartment lives a couple - they smoke pot all the time, even in the stairwell. 

In the next lives a couple with a dog, at my good morning and attempt to talk she looked at me icily and without a word left.

The next thing that depresses me is the state of my health. While the RA has been fairly manageable, the sciatica has been hurting for almost 4 weeks now, and lately after a temporary improvement it has been bad again. 



From my family I only have my mother and sister, but we have a very bad relationship. I can't go back there, when I complain that I have some problems all I hear is that I deserved it. 



All my friends since I am at home and through illness I practically do not go out even no longer answer the phone, because, as they say virtual acquaintance do not want, and since I do not rent an apartment for myself they do not want to come. 



I have a partner who lives 300 km away, we can't live together, he supports himself only with a small disability pension. Even now we can't see each other, I sick - he sick, the doctors don't know how to treat him, he is so weakened that he falls over. 



I no longer want to die - I want to cease to exist.

1jth138,2025-04-07T09:17:30,depression,"Is it depression? Hi, I’m a 39(F) married with kids (4 and 7). I don’t post much but I spend a lot of time here. When I read through posts on depression, I see myself relating to certain things but want some confirmation whether I’m depressed or just thinking I am.

Here’s what I’ve been feeling on and off since 2020 (some days worse than others):

- waking up from a deep sleep and realizing I’m back in reality, dreading the everyday tasks 
- finding every day to be so pointless with mundane chores only to do it all over again tomorrow 
- always wanting to “do something” but not actually finding that particular thing to be fun or interesting once I do it
- unmotivated to do job search because of current job market and just “waiting” for something to find me instead. 
- some days I’m so grateful because of my children, a roof over our heads and being healthy but I go back to negative thoughts again. Telling myself that I should be grateful for what I have. and always thinking that this time in my life should be my happiest because of my kids’ age so I better enjoy it or it’ll be gone before I know it 
- I completely withdraw myself from friends whom I was close with prior to kids. We text here and there but nothing of value. I feel so fake when I say “I’m doing ok” but really, I say that so I don’t have to tell them everything I’m feeling. Pretty sure they don’t have time or care anyway. 
- I’m constantly doing something to make myself feel productive like clean, cook and organize but my house is a complete mess. We just get by day to day  

Sorry for the rambling. It’s hard for me to get my thoughts in an organized way so I just type when it comes to mind. If there’s anyone out there who are in a similar age group as me who feels this way, would love to hear your thoughts. Or anyone who thinks this is a sign of depression or something else, please share.

1jtgsy2,2025-04-07T09:01:02,depression,"Loser Just venting.

  
I hate myself. I'm a failure. In everything. Why.

  
I'm 21M, and I have done nothing. I'm the last child in my family of 9. I have 4 brothers and 4 sisters.

I am not close to anyone but two. My two sisters. We got along well.

I am a disappointment to no one but myself. I don't truly care if I disappoint someone, but I truly loathe myself for failing to meet my expectations. I know you shouldn't live life making sure everyone likes you. I know that. The world isn't nice.

I didn't do well in high school and middle school. Never used to study. In middle school, I did most if not all, of my homework the second it was handed to me in school. Got yelled at home when I was home. My parents thought I didn't do my homework and lied about doing it in school. I didn't know how unreliable and untrustworthy I was to my parents. Can't blame them. I did and still lie to them. I really can't handle them. I am pathetic, and there's no denying that. I was in the lowest performance class, and I didn't care much, tho I did get okay grades. Whenever school finished, I used to go back home and play games, after that go out to play with friends. Used to game a lot, then dad yelled at me. Used to go out a lot, and then Dad yelled at me. After that, I watched TV a lot and then got yelled at a lot. I am useless. All I ever wanted at that time was to do something, I just couldn't find something good. Used to swim a lot in my local area. Really was the best time in my life.

High school was uneventful and dull. Years passed by quickly. Still didn't get good grades. I do wish I studied by myself instead of relying on those horrible teachers.

I was 16 when I finished that school. I transferred to another school and spent a year again in the last grade. I really remember how I couldn't get any answers right on a quiz they gave me. 

17. I finished high school. 18, did nothing. 19 nothing, 20 nothing, 21 and still nothing. I didn't go to uni. My sister thats 2 years older than me, was at the same high school and class at 16 and started uni....I can't remember. But its been 4 years for her and she's finishing uni this year. She was at the same level as me then but now. I'm not envious, jealous or mad. I'm alright with it. I never did feel envy or jealous to anyone because life is just different for everyone. I'm really a failure thru and thru. I'm sometimes uncomfortable being in the same room as her. I just feel unworthy and self-conscious being near her or anyone. All my siblings finished uni. Some have children and are married. I really don't feel like I fit in the family. Everyone is so accomplished, and yet here I am. This kid is still the same.

My relationship with my dad is not the best as well as my mum. I can't talk to them in the eye. I can't be in the same room as them. I try my best to distance myself from them. I don't hate them. I hate myself.

I've been in my home country since I was 13. It's been 8 years. I can't fluently speak the language. I still can't understand the culture here. I still can't fucking speak.....I can talk and hold conversations but I'm still nothing compared to the people here. I hate it here. 

I hate it here. The people are vulgar, loud and greedy. This is just my experiance. Think of it as an idiot babbling. I'm a somewhat of a quite person. I'm respectful to people I met. But why are the people looking at me weird. I don't fit here, nor there or anywhere. 

  
That's it, done venting. 

  
PS: Not suicidal. Uh...I read novels, and I cant bear to part with it.

PSS: This is just 60%. Didn't fully pour my emotions. Didn't want to make this too long",loser venting hate im failure everything im done nothing im last child family brothers sisters close anyone two two sisters got along well disappointment one dont truly care disappoint someone truly loathe failing meet expectations know shouldnt live life making sure everyone likes know world isnt nice didnt well high school middle school never used study middle school homework second handed school got yelled home home parents thought didnt homework lied school didnt know unreliable untrustworthy parents cant blame still lie really cant handle pathetic theres denying lowest performance class didnt care much tho get okay grades whenever school finished used go back home play games go play friends used game lot dad yelled used go lot dad yelled watched tv lot got yelled lot useless ever wanted time something couldnt find something good used swim lot local area really best time life high school uneventful dull years passed quickly still didnt get good grades wish studied instead relying horrible teachers finished school transferred another school spent year last grade really remember couldnt get answers right quiz gave finished high school nothing nothing nothing still nothing didnt go uni sister thats years older high school class started unii cant remember years shes finishing uni year level im envious jealous mad im alright never feel envy jealous anyone life different everyone im really failure thru thru im sometimes uncomfortable room feel unworthy selfconscious near anyone siblings finished uni children married really dont feel like fit family everyone accomplished yet kid still relationship dad best well mum cant talk eye cant room try best distance dont hate hate ive home country since years cant fluently speak language still cant understand culture still cant fucking speaki talk hold conversations im still nothing compared people hate hate people vulgar loud greedy experiance think idiot babbling im somewhat quite person im respectful people met people looking weird dont fit anywhere thats done venting ps suicidal uhi read novels cant bear part pss didnt fully pour emotions didnt want make long,3,1
1jtgryd,2025-04-07T08:58:57,depression,"I'm fat and have been heavily depressed for years, and eating in front of people gives me crippling anxiety Hello everyone. This one is mostly about one particular aspect of my depression. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, more than 10 years that's for sure. Of course I've hade some ""better"" periods but nothing very notable or long-lasting. I've tried several psychiatrist/ologists but I'm completely unable to express myself, I feel dumb and imposter-y (just like I feel now making a post here amongst redditors who are actually able to explain their depression and have """"*serious*"""" problems) everytime I go there, and they just politely blow me off because I can't articulate anything so from their POV I've no reason to be there.        
So. This is about one part of my troubles, that is completely intertwined within my depressive habits. I'm trying to fight it but..... But I don't know how to finish this sentence. 


I'm obese, I know that I am, I'm an adult I've got a scale and I've got mirrors and old pants that don't close anymore, contrary to what some professionals seem to believe, I'm aware of my weight. And I'm absolutely not happy about it, I don't consider it lightly, and I'll never flaunt or try to excuse anything about my body.     
The opposite actually.      
There's not a single minute that I'm awake that I'm not thinking about it. I'm *CONSTANTLY* thinking about how my stomach looks, how my arm fat it wriggling too much, how my fat fingers are too visible in a picture, how I need to hold my head high so that the double-chin is less striking, how my mom is gonna disappointedly stare at my ass and thighs this weekend when I walk through the door, etc etc. 

And the worst of it is food. 40 kilograms ago, I would never give any thought about eating in the breakroom with coworkers, or walking in a restaurant to order take-out, or sitting outside somewhere in a busy city/park to catch a quick bite. Nowadays I make elaborate, minute-by-minute, plans for every meal where I don't cook at home. I stress in advance about every detail of the meal. About how many people are gonna be around, about what I need to wear to dampen the ""obese bum on a binge"" impression I'm gonna give-off, about what the restaurant-employee is gonna think, about which coworker is gonna be on break at the same time (if she watches a show I can get away with more, but if she's a chatter I need to be more mindful of what she's gonna see of me), about the fact that a neighbor could see me with a take-out bag, about needing to locate in advance a recluse spot if I know I'll be eating in a park... I get anxious about EVERYTHING.    
I stress a lot about meals with family or friends. I just calculate in advance what/how much is gonna look acceptable to eat, I'm constantly watching over my shoulders to see if anyone's looking at my plate, and I will sometimes plan ahead a way to sneak a snack before/after so that they'll be glad to see I'm not eating much.

It's come to the point I barely eat anything in front of people anymore. Besides the obligatory meals with my parents when I visit them and the rare invitations (from him or me) to dinner from a friend, I always find a way to eat alone. I live alone, so 90% of my meals are at home, or if not possible it's in my car or alone in the office at work after my boss has left, on the desk in the corner not visible by clients. If I want a snack I'll just wait 'till I have an opportunity to eat one with zero eyes on me, or else I'll let my stomach growl until I can get home.     
When I order food nowadays it's mostly via apps and then the parking pick-up option or if the parking option is not available I pick a restaurant where I know there'll not be a lot of customers inside, to avoid having too much eyes on me when I pick it up. I avoid drive-thrus because I'm ashamed of stating my order out loud, even if it's a pretty basic one, even if I'm just talking at a mic, I feel so self-conscious.      
Sometimes I feel so stressed about being seen eating that I'll even close the living room blinds so that nobody in the building next to mine can see. 

I have a very unhealthy and disturbing relation with food. I often eat bad stuff, and often eat too much (yeah my obesity is absolutely not a mystery). I'm working on it, but it's a tough and slow process. The issue is psychological, and runs very deep, and the problem is that every other issue that I can have is all tangled up with the food one and it's tough to find a beginning and an end.     
So I know it can be very much justified to not want to be seen when I eat ""bad"" meals. But all those feelings, they're there all the time, even when I eat good or just not-so-bad meals. I can't help it. I think about it every second, and get blushy and sweaty and panicky if I ever have to eat in public.

I'd like to be able to eat a cereal-bar in public without getting so anxious about people around that I feel like throwing up.


Anyways.     
I wasn't planning on it getting this long. I just had a brief thought about it and figured I could maybe find a place somewhere on Reddit to air this all out.

At the concert i was convinced i was second hand high and basically went nuts and freaked out and couldn’t breathe. and since then i’ve just been spiraling. i’ve tried therapy, meds and everything, nothing works and im so scared this is the end and im just going to snap and my life will be over. I don’t believe in my own existence i don’t believe that others have this awareness that i do, i feel like i am living on auto pilot and all memories feel like dreams that didn’t happen. People are distorted and sometimes my brain forgets who i am around. I am also so paranoid about irrational things but my brain can’t escape it.

I worry that this is permanent or if i talked my self into this, i have had OCD and anxiety since i was about 9.

1jtfhji,2025-04-07T07:20:21,depression,"Depression feels like the only help ill ever have Help please

I know to anyone reading this im just another poor unfortunate soul, but im forcing myself to type this out as a means of getting it out of my system even if i feel ashamed to even be trying so hard to get out of my own head.

I turn 20 this month and I cant help but feel like how does a human being go about their days basically wasting so much time…

All I can remember from the beginning of time is that Ive been quiet this entire time, so to combat this for once I’ll actually try to make an effort to speak on my situation…

I’m a country girl, who’s never had much and I pretty much was raised on false hope that I was going to do anything big that I could turn things around for myself but the more i age the more i start to realize I was doomed from the start.

My mom never cared for me much, the bare minimum has always seemed to be enough and my da was never around.

Now, I don’t know what made them think it was a wise idea to have me seeing that 10 years prior to my birth they were never meant to be together but I digress…

But I think it’s almost deliberate that they had a child knowing they were going to bring me into a world of suffering. They knew they were poor, they knew they didn’t love each other, they obviously weren’t even cut out for children.

My dad left when i was 5, and everything seemed normal for a while until I had to go to hs and then if things weren’t already stressful enough with being bullied my mom decided to take her own life.

Unsuccessfully ofcourse.

And due to all the religious trauma she had she developed schizophrenia and depression, I was 14 when this all happened and it really seemed like at this point in my life I wasn’t even going to make it that far without much help.

Luckily for me I didn’t get any help, and somehow Im still here…

Why? I wish i knew the answer myself…

I cried almost every night as this was right before covid hit and even though the quarantine at the time was a blessing in disguise, it really felt like the nail in the coffin for me.

Like I was never meant to have a normal life, i was bound for loneliness, for failure, for nothing great.

I was never loved, I wasn’t given a chance, I was never given patience 
And time was never on my side.

Ive been trapped by my parent’s decisions for life even if it means i make it out of here alive. Nothing will erase the past and I was never meant to have a peace of mind. 

My only fear at this point is dying like i never existed in the first place.

I have nothing to my name, Ive made nothing of myself, and I really think at this point in my life that this was meant to be my normal all along.

This is my only purpose, this is all i have left to give to the world.",depression feels like help ill ever help please know anyone reading im another poor unfortunate soul im forcing type means getting system even feel ashamed even trying hard get head turn month cant help feel like human go days basically wasting much time remember beginning time ive quiet entire time combat ill actually try make effort speak situation im country girl whos never much pretty much raised false hope going anything big could turn things around age start realize doomed start mom never cared much bare minimum always seemed enough da never around dont know made think wise idea seeing years prior birth never meant together digress think almost deliberate child knowing going bring world suffering knew poor knew didnt love obviously werent even cut children dad left everything seemed normal go hs things werent already stressful enough bullied mom decided take life unsuccessfully ofcourse due religious trauma developed schizophrenia depression happened really seemed like point life wasnt even going make far without much help luckily didnt get help somehow im still wish knew answer cried almost every night right covid hit even though quarantine time blessing disguise really felt like nail coffin like never meant normal life bound loneliness failure nothing great never loved wasnt given chance never given patience time never side ive trapped parents decisions life even means make alive nothing erase past never meant peace mind fear point dying like never existed first place nothing name ive made nothing really think point life meant normal along purpose left give world,3,1

The constant feeling has been exhaustion and lack of will to do anything. I was diagnosed with bipolar depression in 2019 and have since been going through the works of trying out different concoctions of medications and meeting with my therapist. College was a wreck and lead to my dropping out. I’ve been sitting at home with my parents for the last 2 years, unable to get myself into looking for a job, and slowly succumbing to where I am now: struggling to do personal hygiene, refusing to go outside, gets anxiety and the minimalist of things, and absolutely cannot get myself to go see my horse. 

I am not suicidal, but I’m just so tired of yelling at myself to just do it (it being whatever task) and having it fall into this chasm of emptiness that separates my wants and my actions. I’m eating, taking my meds regularly, and sleeping a lot. I have a small social life online, I read, I talk to my parents everyday. My mom has been the hardass “I NEED you to do this… You NEED to get this done” supportive side, while my dad has been the overly energetic “hey, why don’t you come with me?… How can can I help you?… you can do it” supportive side. I’m just so tired of making them worry. I’m so ashamed of myself; embarrassed, disappointed. I don’t know what to do anymore, other than curl up in a ball and fall back asleep.

1jteuhy,2025-04-07T06:34:19,depression,"Not suicidal anymore but totally numb Hey. Not really sure why I’m writing this, but maybe it’ll click for someone. Or maybe something will click for me.

I don’t get those intense suicidal thoughts anymore. That phase is over. Never made an attempt - maybe because I always felt like if I tried, I’d succeed, and weirdly, that kind of kept me from trying. Ironic.

Now it’s more like… I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to live either. Just stuck in the middle. Like someone pulled the handbrake in my brain. Nothing’s on fire, but nothing’s moving. It’s neutrally bad. Indifferently sad. Been like this for over a year. Maybe longer. I honestly don’t know anymore. The years blurred.

I take Fluoxetine daily. Not prescribed - I just started taking it on my own and kept going. Sort of like chewing nicotine gum after quitting smoking - not because it helps, just to avoid the crash. Brain zaps and that whole withdrawal mess, you know. I’m barely keeping it together as is.

I try to keep myself busy, but even watching a 40-minute episode of a show can take me days or weeks to actually sit through. I just want to get through the day without thinking too much, but almost nothing holds my attention. Or it overwhelms me. Or both.

Depression basically wiped out my social life. I don’t have the energy or the need to rebuild it. Loneliness became standard. Sometimes even comfortable. It only really bothers me when I’ve spent too long in my own head, which I guess is what triggered this post. But hey, maybe writing this will top up my social battery for the week. Or two.

I’m 29, male, Eastern Europe. Living like a ghost who hasn’t realized he’s dead yet.

I’m not looking for advice or sympathy. Just needed to let this out. Maybe someone out there feels the same.

1jtdyqo,2025-04-07T05:31:49,depression,"Suggestions for dealing with apathy in relationships? I’m 24F and in a relationship with my lovely girlfriend who is 23F. We’ve been together for almost 2 years now but have been friends for much longer.

The biggest strain on our relationship are my struggles with disability and chronic pain. However my mental health is very quickly making things even more difficult and I know that I’m hurting her. One of  these is episodes of intense apathy that I get during during mood swings when I feel depressed. I’ve always been an overly empathic person but after a traumatic health event resulting in further disability, I’m no longer the same. Especially with my depression.

I love her so much but I go through times where I just feel like I don’t really care as much about her or anything, I’m just so numb. Lately more often than not. I come off as cold and insensitive and I feel so awful about it. At the worst times, it’s like all the love I have for her is just gone. My therapist has attributed it to my MDD diagnosis but I’m sure it’s likely caused by multiple of my diagnoses, but mainly the MDD. I’ve been on over 2 dozen meds, but nothing has relieved my depression in the slightest.

She knows how much I struggle mentally, but I can tell that’s she’s losing hope in how important she is to me. I can’t imagine a life without her and I’ve never met anyone as kind, patient and understanding as her. She has always supported me through everything. I cannot lose her but I’m so tired of hurting her and she deserves to feel important and loved.

As you all may or may not know about me, my dream is to get noticed in the Media field as either an editor or voice-actor. Editing videos and trying voice-acting are 2 things I love to do. However, I've tried since I was a teenager to get represented or noticed, but have had no luck whatsoever. I've taken college classes for editing and have also taken acting and voice-acting classes from professionals, but have pretty much come to realize that it's impossibly competitive to get into the business at all.

In fact, it's so impossibly competitive that I've pretty much given up on even trying to get myself noticed. I can't market myself, because I don't have the skills to do so. I even have a website and demo reels on it, but not the skills to sell myself. Not to mention I don't live where all the jobs and agencies are and can't afford to. And both my depression and anxiety, massive factors in this, will only ever get worse and worse even with the meds I take.

The other thing is that I believe that even if someone wanted to represent me to help me get noticed, it still wouldn't happen because I'm neurodivergent. Autism to be exact, which I believe is a mental illness. Which is why I have to ask the question. Is it even worth attempting to try anymore? Not just to get noticed, but doing so in a way that will make me happy? Or at 37 years old, should I just give up and be a bum the rest of my life?

However I'm 22 now and the last 2 years have been hell. I dont know why but out of nowhere I start feeling extremely depressed, insane brain fog and head aches/tension, binge eating a lot, can't think straight and irritable, feel like I dont have control over myself and I get this feeling of continiously losing myself more and more. Some days I get a glimpse of feeling ""normal"" again. Have a little bit clearer head, more leveled out, more present etc. Far from perfect but ALOT better than these negative phases, which unfortunately take up about 90% of my life the past 2 years.

Tried several antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, mood stabilizers, Vit D, Omega 3, etc. got my hormones checked, sleep kinda checked (I got this EKG for 1 night but I would like a complete sleep study). I tried all these things but I still get these phases where I feel like I'm going insane.

Nothing yet has really improved my symptoms/mood so I'm asking you guys for advice.

long story short, i was in an on an off relationship from the age of 17-19 during this relationship, my partner and i grew very codependent to each other.

we grew to do everything with each other, and this caused it to be very difficult to know when to end the relationship. this hurt us, and we hurt each other (mentally) bc of our unwillingness to be alone.

my ex partner ended up finding a new partner, but in the duration that they were together, my ex and i were still very codependent.

i’m trying to break the cycle of codependency now because they seem genuinely happy now.

the only problem is that i’m struggling so badly. i’ve always had problems with depression, self esteem and loneliness. but it has been extremely bad and exhausting now.

i’ve tried it all, therapy, medication, and everything. nothing has helped.

1jtff6h,2025-04-07T07:15:35,mentalhealth,"Depression feels like the only help ill ever have I know to anyone reading this im just another poor unfortunate soul, but im forcing myself to type this out as a means of getting it out of my system even if i feel ashamed to even be trying so hard to get out of my own head.

I turn 20 this month and I cant help but feel like how does a human being go about their days basically wasting so much time…

All I can remember from the beginning of time is that Ive been quiet this entire time, so to combat this for once I’ll actually try to make an effort to speak on my situation…

I’m a country girl, who’s never had much and I pretty much was raised on false hope that I was going to do anything big that I could turn things around for myself but the more i age the more i start to realize I was doomed from the start.

My mom never cared for me much, the bare minimum has always seemed to be enough and my da was never around.

Now, I don’t know what made them think it was a wise idea to have me seeing that 10 years prior to my birth they were never meant to be together but I digress…

But I think it’s almost deliberate that they had a child knowing they were going to bring me into a world of suffering. They knew they were poor, they knew they didn’t love each other, they obviously weren’t even cut out for children.

My dad left when i was 5, and everything seemed normal for a while until I had to go to hs and then if things weren’t already stressful enough with being bullied my mom decided to take her own life.

Unsuccessfully ofcourse.

And due to all the religious trauma she had she developed schizophrenia and depression, I was 14 when this all happened and it really seemed like at this point in my life I wasn’t even going to make it that far without much help.

Luckily for me I didn’t get any help, and somehow Im still here…

Why? I wish i knew the answer myself…

I cried almost every night as this was right before covid hit and even though the quarantine at the time was a blessing in disguise, it really felt like the nail in the coffin for me.

Like I was never meant to have a normal life, i was bound for loneliness, for failure, for nothing great.

I was never loved, I wasn’t given a chance, I was never given patience 
And time was never on my side.

Ive been trapped by my parent’s decisions for life even if it means i make it out of here alive. Nothing will erase the past and I was never meant to have a peace of mind. 

My only fear at this point is dying like i never existed in the first place.

I have nothing to my name, Ive made nothing of myself, and I really think at this point in my life that this was meant to be my normal all along.

I failed the internship that could have given me a job. I'm not sure what happened and I feel like a failure. I never really had any self-confidence, my I knew I had found the job for me.

 I went back to school as a young mother approaching 30 and studied with passion in the field. I got excellent grades. But I didn't get THE internship. I gave it my all. This was the first time my supervisor had taken on an intern. Right from the start, I sensed that my internship supervisor didn't seem interested in training anyone. He often sent me off with others or neglected me and went off to do his own thing. But I tried. I asked for his feedback, but he wasn't someone who communicated with me, so I never knew if what I was doing was right or wrong. During the internship evaluation, he brought up several situations that would have happened that I have no recollection of. Yet these were events that would have had an impact on me. I recognize some of the mistakes I've made, but I can't remember some of the things I've been accused of. He even said I needed to hise my tattoos event tho they never said that to me and there was a lot of other peoples with tattoos !

What's more, many of my shortcomings could have been eliminated if my supervisor had given me feedback on my work. He even told me after I'd failed that he wouldn't be taking any more intern because it wasn't what he thought it was and he didn't believe it was right for him

So I was his test. My future was a test for this person. I could apply again for the job in one year but I just cant help but wondering if I was this bad.

1jtdsha,2025-04-07T05:20:08,mentalhealth,"living with trauma induced depression WARNING: PHYSICAL WOUNDS AND SCARS USED AS METAPHORS 
*note: this isn’t formatted as a poem, but it contains a heavy use of metaphors, which is why i used the poetry flair.



Since what happened, I have been living with deep and painful wounds on my body. With time, these wounds have begun scabbing. 

These wounds however, still beg to be explored on occasion, forcing me to unwrap my bandages, to give them a small cleaning. And sometimes it’s difficult to wrap them back up, leaving my injuries vulnerable. They rub against surfaces, make contact with dangerous bacterias, and I fear the thought of someone pointing them out.

And other days, they demand my attention, without even asking. If I’m not careful, my bandages come undone all by themselves, at a time I couldn’t have predicted. They scream at me, they bleed violently. They require a wash, and a new wrap. But it hurts. It hurts to clean these wounds, and it hurts even more when I don’t clean them after they’ve nagged me to do so.

So, I’m left with no option but to clean them, and rewrap them. And if i do not proceed with caution, the only developing scabs will fall off, and it is apparent that i have not let them sit for long enough. And as this unfolds, I am left with raw flesh, flesh that is painful to the touch, impossible to ignore, and can only make me go backwards. 




*main takeaway: recovery is hard, but it’s possible. this is just how it feels for me, a teenager, too young to even fully process her trauma, but old enough to face the constant nagging it leaves. it really does eat away at your mind, hindering your ability to perform basic tasks, to even get up in the morning. you aren’t lazy, you aren’t dumb, you are wounded, and those wounds require time to heal. take it easy.

1jt7igb,2025-04-06T23:28:34,addiction,"Why doesn’t he care? I’d been with my now ex husband 10+ years before I discovered he had secretly started using drugs and quickly became addicted to IV meth & engaging in chemsex.

Despite all my own pain, I tried to navigate supporting him for the last 3 years. We have two small children together and quite frankly I didn’t want him to die. I hoped I could help him get back to the person he used to be.

I work full time yet struggle financially each month, it’s been exhausting managing the kids, him and the emotional toil that it’s taken. 

Last week when he relapsed again rather than use some of his promised funds to buy his children clothes, I just knew I’d hit my limit.  I told him not to contact us again. That if he wanted to fight for his kids he could go through the proper channels. I can’t manage this or his risk anymore. My priority is protecting those children and focusing on my own wellbeing so I can be there for them. 

I’ve had to grieve so much and I’ve come to a point now where I’ve accepted he may very well die soon (he’s had two close calls so far). 

I’m blessed that I do not know what addiction feels like, but equally I cannot understand how it could have gotten to this point where the fix is so important it’s destroyed his life and will likely kill him. He’s had great support from NA & drug services as well as EMDR. 

This is what I’d like to try and gain perspective of - I feel like it’s a missing piece of my grief puzzle in understanding why he does not seem to care - about our children, about his own life… I hoped it would be okay to ask for that here? Was it that he never really loved us and we were just a convenience? Or can you fall so far into this that nothing else matters? 

It just hurts. So much. And the guilt for letting go, but knowing I’ve had to for the sake of my own sanity… I never ever imagined my life would be this way.

1jt55hr,2025-04-06T21:35:29,addiction,"Its not really a joke anymore. (advice is welcome) Im like genuinely an addict and I can't even deny it anymore.

Like 2 years ago I started going heavy with caffeine, like to the point that i would have comedowns and withdrawals, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, i looked and felt like a corpse. But it was a joke, 'its just coffee' after all, right? 6, 7, 8 cups a day is fiiiine, im fine.
I started popping caffeine pills like fucking candy because coffee just wasn't enough for me anymore, and lying, and hiding it, but people knew. 

it still felt like a joke ""oh you know me, im just a bit of a coffee addict lol""
I passed out in the middle of the city one evening because my heart was tapping, and not even that scared me enough to stop.
After some months of this I started wanting to try smthg real, mdma, speed, coke ...meth.
But i couldn't find any, i didn't know anyone. So i went to reddit and found a post saying that ritalin was very similar when snorted, and i just. Kept. Thinking about it. So i crossed my first hard line, i stole medication off a family member.

I could justify it to myself because it was an old prescription, they where currently taking a different one, so the Elvanse and ritalin where just sitting there, not being used. I wasn't really taking medication someone needs.
I started taking the elvanse with a cup of coffee sometimes at school. (totally just to focus, right?) It made me feel all buzzed and warm and happy, what I was chasing that i could no longer get from caffeine.

When I snorted my first line of ritalin it was right before a meeting with mental health services, I was feeling like shit and just wanting somethingto take the edge off. 

It burned and was all sour running down my throat, but god did I fall in love with it.
I thought about it all the time. doing bumps of ritalin when I went out drinking with my best friend, she know basically everything, but she always just laughed it off. But I couldn't have fun without it, at all anymore.

The morning i woke up so hungover after I ditched my friends to go out and get high by myself for the first time
I felt sick to my stomach with guilt about everything. I made a choice addicts make. I crossed another line.


During a visit with a long distance friend. They asked another friend of ours for a sleeve of her Amfexa. Adhd medication That they DID need. Line crossed. 

It was in front of me and i couldn't make myself say no. I wanted it so bad, I missed it more that anything.  So the next morning we did some, than some more, then some more. After the second sleepless night my friend proposed a trade - they give me more speed if i sleep with them. Now of course, i said no to that insane offer!

Lmao i fucking wish.
No. Actually what happened is i was so desperate for one more hit that I said 'yeah im not above that'
So I sucked dick for a line of amphetamine. 
I couldn't really think of a way to justify that one. Especially not when i was currently coming down hard on my way to the airport to go back home. It didn't really feel like a joke anymore.

I used a lot more regularly when i got home. I was smoking more, and relapsing hard in my ED. I was so depressed, and felt so alone. Somehow no one really seemed to notice or care. One night like 4 days after i got back i had some ritalin that I cut with caffeine powder, My best friend watched me do line after line after line of that shit at a party, and it was actually her dickbag new boyfriend that seemed to think she should be more concerned about me.

Well that was six months ago, and that friend is not in my life anymore, im still kinda using, but infrequently - mostly due to lack of access.

Well that brings me to Yesterday. I was at a club with my girlfriend, just drinking, no drugs. I stil had so much fun. 
Well at the very end of the night i went to the bathroom before we left and lo and behold: sombebody left a clump of coke on the edge of sink. And i know it was coke because my lips and tongue went numb when I fucking. licked. it. up. 
Did I mention I am intensely afraid of germs?

I just couldn't pull myself away from it, i couldn't just leave it there. After like 5 minutes of shaking and maniacally cry-laughing over it, I called my girlfriend in to help me because i couldn't move. she had to physically force my hand under the faucet because i couldn't make myself rinse the rest of the FUCKING MYSTERY POWDER off my finger.

So yeah. The jig is up. I think im just fully a drug addict, I'm only 20. I've crossed so many hard lines i swore i never would. I hate myself so fkn much.

1jt4dvu,2025-04-06T21:00:12,addiction,"Stuck in a crack house—advice from users are appreciated! Hi, getting straight to the point—I am not yet a legal adult under the care of my mother and father, alongside my eldest brother and three younger siblings. This context is needed in my situation.

So, a couple years back, my parents had gotten into using crack and meth, but once my mother became pregnant with my youngest brother, she and my father became sober after two near death experiences with substances. They were sober for a year or so, until recently, they have relapsed and started using crack again. 

I hold no judgement to those who do substances, I’ve been around them all of my life—it’s only an issue now that they’ve brought it into the home instead of running off for weeks on end. When they had first started using, I left to another household, unfortunately this isn’t available now.

My parents now have a complete disregard for me and my siblings safety, bringing this substance into the house. And now onto why I made this post.

Last night, they kicked me out of the room I was staying in to smoke crack, and I have no knowledge on how it works besides smoking it with a pipe. Many questions and concerns follow my lack of knowledge, such as—can you get second hand high? Can the substance stick to clothes, surfaces, or stay in the air? My main concern is that this substance will end up in my system or my siblings. They smoked in the vicinity of my belongings and I’m unsure if they’re safe to touch. 

I only stay at home part time, as I attend something similar to a boarding school—where I live on a campus. I graduate soon and I’ve been planning to go to college, but I fear them relapsing is putting my life to a halt.

Any and all advice is appreciated, from crack users with experience themselves, or anyone who can offer help, it’s always welcome. Also forgive me—this is kind of a last resort as I have no resources on this type of thing, and I assume that strangers online might be able to help, so excuse me if this post isn’t really normal or up to standard? It’s my first ever on Reddit.

1jsn212,2025-04-06T05:36:14,addiction,"Addicted and just want to stop So I’ve just turned 30. I’ve been on meth since I was 14. I was 20 when I had more than 1 day off the stuff and the only reason is because I was in jail. I was in there for just over a year. As soon as I got out I was straight back on it. 

The next stint of abstinence was in 2020 … i was now 26. I jumped off a balcony and shattered my pelvis im 6x places. I got flown to another state for surgery and decided fuck it…im gonna get clean! I lasted 9months and then fell off the wagon. It was suprisingly ‘easy’ i think because i had my partner and he did it with me.

Since then I think I’ve relapsed and tried to get clean 3 more times and only ever manage to get 3-5months clean, then I seem to get bored or something and relapse.

Must be 2 years ago now roughly, I learnt how to shoot myself up. New level of addiction  🔓 
I very quickly spiraled even worse than my life and my mental health already was, and decided to put myself in rehab for. I stayed for 5months. I was going strong!!! But now im almost 5 months deep in a relapse and I cannot stop shooting up. 

I have no siblings, and only really have my mum. I don’t have 1 friend that isn’t on the shit, like not 1!!! Im having trouble finding purpose at this point, other than crocheting, I don’t do anything. Except shoot meth.

1jsm4b3,2025-04-06T04:35:47,addiction,"Brother becoming alcoholic. Can I prevent it? Hi everyone, any advice is appreciated. For some background my brother is 22yrs old and im 24yrs. We both lived at home with our parents prior. I moved away 8 months ago to a different state for a job and since then my brother started drinking heavily at night (both of us rarely ever drank, both of our parents are alcoholics and it affected our childhoods so we avoided it).  He would start to call me late at night drunk and crying about everything that was wrong in our childhoods and how much he misses me, but also envy’s me. He has also told me he wishes his life would end, through external forces not his own hand, but still. This obviously concerns me and I feel so helpless. I have tried talking to my parents to help, but they can’t even help themselves or admit they have a problem. During the day when he was sober I tried bringing up seeking out a different or another therapist or trying a day program, but he told me off and was extremely offended. Everyone in his life enables him (parents and gf), I think they have been berated by him as well and are complying to avoid conflict. It’s easy to, especially since the next day after one of the nights he drinks he acts as though nothing happened and is completely normal - even happy. 

I can’t help but feel responsible with the timing of this, and because i’ve now come to realize that he was very dependent on me. With the failings of our parents I had to step in and act almost as a parent. I’ve developed really bad anxiety from this, every day around 7pm I start getting anxious, just reaction sometimes I don’t even realize why I feel that way until I look at the time. I’ve started not picking up the phone as much, but its awful I feel I might miss the one call where he’s gonna actually hurt himself or escalate in some way if I don’t pick up. I just want to help makes things better for him, it seems he’s unhappy with his life, his partner, and our parents and doesn’t see a way out (at least thats his viewpoint when drunk). But sober he doesn’t have these complaints, at least life and partner wise. I’ve tried suggesting things that helped me get out or feel better while living at home in that environment but I’m not sure it’s helping. I feel if he could move out his situation would improve, but he has a hard time saving and has been having a hard time finding a job he can do while balancing trade school.

I know it might get much worse from here and am asking if anyone has a similar experience with a loved one or went through this themselves what the next step or best thing to do here is. I just started seeing a therapist to take care of myself and my anxiety, but I need help with how to support and be there for my brother.

1jsktub,2025-04-06T03:16:56,addiction,"Ruminating on the problem holds you back A lot of us who have dealt with and are dealing with addiction have tried therapy and gave up or reject the whole idea. That is fine, because most therapists will just indulge in people’s obsessions. 

You have to break the obsession of your own pain, ruminating these thoughts sitting with you day in and day out, break them out of your mind. That’s why we used drugs, to break them out. 

When I have a relapse, or in the past during heavy binges, it would be like a ticking time bomb. At first I’d be doing good, then ruminating and watching other people live mindless lives somehow being happy, then eventually cave. 

My pain wasn’t that other people were happy and I wasn’t, it was that I believed I was better than others but didn’t get the attention I deserved, so using was a way of me breaking those thoughts out and giving myself credit for who I am. 

The truth is you, whoever you are, are a unique and awesome person, no matter what life has thrown on you or what you’ve thrown yourself into. You don’t have to ruminate anymore or make bad decisions to remind yourself who you are. Get out of your habitual thoughts of your pain, as real as it might be, and live your life. 

The one thing more real than pain is love.

I take care of myself, holistically. no smoking, hardly any drinking, no drugs. my biggest crutch is that I have had asthma for most of my life and relied heavily on inhalers until I started dupixent recently (which is such a game changer btw).
a year ago I got flu A and I wound up in the ER with a 103 fever and a heart rate of about 175 bpm and low blood oxygen (mine normally lies at 95-97%). I spent a few hours there and it really affected me mentally in a way I never figured it would. I was SO scared and hyper fixated on my blood oxygen, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. I thought I was going to die my heart rate was so out of control and I felt like there was a 100 lb stone on my chest. I learned I had double pneumonia. I was never admitted (thank god- I know that outcome is so common and I realize it could have been worse). I spent about 3 weeks in absolute hell holed up in the house recovering, I could not take a few steps without being absolutely winded and lightheaded. 
now, a year later, whenever I get a slight illness, I am brought back to that time and place in my life and worrying about not surviving another round of pneumonia or lung infection.

So, I was on Sertaline for a while. 25mg, then 50mg. They helped with my anxiety, definitely, but at the cost of my imagination. I couldn't fucking daydream anymore and I lost my interest in fanfiction because I couldn't visualize the stories very well anymore.

So, I decided to ween myself off of them. Surprisingly, I didn't get any massive side-effects (don't do this still, I've heard it's really bad). And my imagination returned, but so did my anxiety/OCD rumminidations. 

I have maladaptive daydreaming, and I genuinely can't live without it. It's my only consistent entertainment and comfort, and as much as my ruminations suck, I'd rather deal with them then be unable to daydream. 

But still, I really don't want to live like this. I don't want to spend hours laying in bed complicating suicide because of a mistake I made a year ago and having panic attacks over it. It's not an enjoyable life. I liked the calmness Sertaline gave me, but I can't trade in my ability to daydream for it.

1jtgyfy,2025-04-07T09:11:53,Anxiety,"My relationship is making my anxiety worse, which is making me sad. Am I being too sensitive or is it valid to feel this way? I've been with my boyfriend just under a year, i love and care for him dearly. If I'm honest with myself, during the course of our relationship I've felt my mental health, anxiety, self worth plummet and unfortunately I think it's because of my boyfriend and the relationship.

I've always struggled with my mental health, due to past experiences and childhood trauma, but after years of therapy and working hard on myself more recently I was feeling great, more confident in myself etc, people in my life noticed and commented on how much I'd grown. Which felt great, so I started dating again.

Since meeting, our relationship has been great, but also troubled, mainly due to my boyfriends need to talk about his ex, something that was present from the start. Part of me feels like maybe I'm being too sensitive to it all and being over dramatic, but I truly feel like after 9/10 months of having regular chats about how him talking about his ex all the time is bringing me down, it's gotten to the point I feel it's caused some damage and I've just broken.

It's been comparing, talking about her body, how great her body, bum, boobs are, how confident she is, how she never needed make up, how people (guys) ogled over her, telling me times they had great sex, what sex toys they used and how \*i would probably enjoy it too\*, positions they did, sharing details details in front of friends, talking about her randomly in convo most days, saying he still found her attractive, that he feels bitter towards her and the relationship, bringing her up every time he drinks, I could go on.

The ex talk for a prolonged about of time has shattered my self confidence, I've spent months feeling like I'm not good enough, second best, like there's three of us in this relationship and asking him to not share this information with me, but it just kept on happening, he didn't seem to understand why it was a problem or bothering me, it's taken time but I think he finally gets it, after I properly broke down about 5 weeks ago.

Also, there has been times I've felt he's been quite critical, mean, or made odd comments to bring me down, just a few examples: 'I like your bum, some guys would want a girl with a bigger ass but I like it', he's told me many times I need to 'grow a backbone' and if something bothers me and he clearly doesn't agree he'll mock and make fun of it or say it's just my anxiety again, until I asked him to stop he'd always mock me for only doing cardio at the gym, making fun of me for not doing weights. I got really upset at a party for halloween, it was peak him making me feel awful with all the ex chat, which he likes to bring up and tell people how I got super upset and hysterical at the party (in the bathroom), to the point he literally brought it up again to my best friend last night, but he was the reason I was upset, which of course gets left out.

I've voiced this somewhat to him recently, but I don't think he understands how bad he's made me feel and I feel like a bit of a d\*ck for saying so, but the way he's made me feel, the things said over the relationship have made my anxiety, mental health, sense of worth and self worse. I know how I felt when we started dating and I feel like a shell of myself, like all that hard work and I'm back to feeling worthless, and I feel like an awful person for even thinking that I think it's (unintentionally) my boyfriends fault.

He's chipped away at me slowly and it's created some wounds, which has given me so many triggers over little things which makes me feel like I'm just overreacting at the smallest things now, which maybe I am. I'm constantly in a state of worry, overthinking, wanting to check he / we are okay, yes I'm an anxious person, but this isn't me, I feel frustrated with myself but my anxiety has been so heightened. It makes me worried, stressed and sad. I just want to cry all the time, or feel constantly on the verge of tears when I'm with him and do get upset often when were together cos I'm so easily triggered.

I feel like we / I have a chat about this, the ex chat, how it's made me feel, how he's making me feel once a month at least, which doesn't feel healthy. Am I overreacting and being too sensitive to all this, I often feel bad for talking about it, like I'm picking at him or giving him grief, being hard work and a bad girlfriend.",relationship making anxiety worse making sad sensitive valid feel way ive boyfriend year love care dearly im honest course relationship ive felt mental health anxiety self worth plummet unfortunately think boyfriend relationship ive always struggled mental health due past experiences childhood trauma years therapy working hard recently feeling great confident etc people life noticed commented much id grown felt great started dating since meeting relationship great also troubled mainly due boyfriends need talk ex something present start part feels like maybe im sensitive dramatic truly feel like months regular chats talking ex time bringing gotten point feel caused damage ive broken comparing talking body great body bum boobs confident never needed make people guys ogled telling times great sex sex toys used would probably enjoy positions sharing details details front friends talking randomly convo days saying still found attractive feels bitter towards relationship bringing every time drinks could go ex talk prolonged time shattered self confidence ive spent months feeling like im good enough second best like theres three us relationship asking share information kept happening didnt seem understand problem bothering taken time think finally gets properly broke weeks ago also times ive felt hes quite critical mean made odd comments bring examples like bum guys would want girl bigger ass like hes told many times need grow backbone something bothers clearly doesnt agree hell mock make fun say anxiety asked stop hed always mock cardio gym making fun weights got really upset party halloween peak making feel awful ex chat likes bring tell people got super upset hysterical party bathroom point literally brought best friend last night reason upset course gets left ive voiced somewhat recently dont think understands bad hes made feel feel like bit dck saying way hes made feel things said relationship made anxiety mental health sense worth self worse know felt started dating feel like shell like hard work im back feeling worthless feel like awful person even thinking think unintentionally boyfriends fault hes chipped away slowly created wounds given many triggers little things makes feel like im overreacting smallest things maybe im constantly state worry overthinking wanting check okay yes im anxious person isnt feel frustrated anxiety heightened makes worried stressed sad want cry time feel constantly verge tears im get upset often together cos im easily triggered feel like chat ex chat made feel hes making feel month least doesnt feel healthy overreacting sensitive often feel bad talking like im picking giving grief hard work bad girlfriend,2,2

1jtg9bx,2025-04-07T08:18:55,Anxiety,"Navigating withdrawal after 8yrs taking benzos Context:

• 25 yo (F)
• Diagnoses: Generalised anxiety disorder + mild OCD 
• Trouble sleeping due to night terrors (started at 3 yo, never slept ok until treatmemt) 
• Taking sertraline (Zoloft) for 8 yrs = lifesaver
• Taking lorazepam (Ativan) for 8-9 yrs 

I would really love some advice as I'm struggling with stopping lorazepam. 2-3 years ago I started falling asleep during the day, couldn't resist the urge to sleep. When it became a struggle I went to the neurologist, whom sent me to a sleep neurologist specialist. I was in the diagnostic process for narcolepsy for about a year. During that time my doctor found a hormone imbalance (extremely high prolactine, high even if I was pregnant, which I wasnt) as well as slightly enlarged hyphopysis. They recommended some other analysis a follow up but never gave me a date. 

A month later I check in again with them, repeat my hormonal levels which turn out to be pretty normal.

Time passes by and I don't receive a date for my follow up (I haven't yet, 6 months later; spanish public health system works in mysterious ways).

One day my flatmate's mom (a really good doctor) sees me fall assleep suddenly and decides to take me in as her patient (I live in another city so she technically could not be my doctor). She explains to me that I'm experiencing the side effects of taking benzodiacepines for 8 yrs and I learn it should not be a chronic treatment for many reasons.

1jtg2sx,2025-04-07T08:04:40,Anxiety,"Anxiety, burnout, depression or all of them Hi all,

  
I know that maybe what I am going to tell you does not sound that big of a deal, but from some reason for me it is exhausting, even though if you look from the outside everything looks quite good. Just a little bit of context, I am working in a corporation from home as a programmer, I am married for one year, we bought a house 4 years ago.

First thing that is bothering me and I do not know why is that, at work sometimes I feel so anxious and sometimes so depressed, there are days where I cannot implement a tak in one week, and other days where I can implement the same task in half a day, and it seems like every year this thing is getting worse and worse. What I saw that helps me, but only a little bit is that every day at lunch break I take a ride with my bike 1 hour, but it seems like for the last 6 months even this will not help that much as it was helping before. Just to understand at work I have a great team, great boss everything is fine, there is no pressure, if you cannot finish something is not a problem, but somehow a feel some kind of anxiety and depression. I also bought a glucoze monitor and I have found out that when I am at work the glucoze is rising beyond normal limits, I have checked in weekend and when I had days off and there the glucoze is fine.

  
The second part that is bothering me are the renovations. So, we bought this house 4 years ago and we are renovating somehow year by year depending on the budget, parts of the house. So you can live in the house, is no problem of not living, but things are old and need to be changed. Now, I do not say anything, but when my wife brings this up, it somehow getting me verry stressed. Just to know when I was in the process of buying the house each morning I felt like vomiting, like for 15 days. Now this is what happening with me again, each morning I cannot eat, I fell like vomiting, I cannot think, I cannot do anything somehow and cannot enjoy anything. Here just to know everything is planned, we have organized how it should be done, from where to buy necessary things, what to buy and have very good guys who are renovating and very organized.

  
The third part is that I am not having friends, like each year have less and less. If in highschool and faculty I had tens of friends, last year had like 4-5 and this year 2 of them moved in other countries and the other 2 had children, I am not saying that having children should affect the friendship, but from that point they are not going out, from seeing weekly, maybe we are seeing now 2 times per year, so now I do not have people with whom to hang out.

So I pointed out those 3 points thinking that those can be the root causes of why I am feelling so anxious, depressed and maybe I am having a burnout, but I do not know. So now for a couple of months I cannot eat how I supposed to eat, I feel like vomiting in the morning for the last weeks, I feel like I have to cry, I am having each month some days where I feel like my brain cannot think. Some weeks per month I want just to dissapear, I have some thoughts like to be implied in some accidents, to end up in hospital, to have some illness that cannot be cured and so one, why in hell I have such thoughts?

If before I had friends, I was running, going with my bike, socialising, going hiking, now I feel like I do not like those anymore, like my brain somehow is doing something intentional in order to not do those.

Again, I know that maybe other have bigger issues in this group and this may seems like not a big deal, but I did not know where to write or talk about this.

1jtersh,2025-04-07T06:28:51,Anxiety,"Compulsive/binge eating anxiety Possible TW for eating disorder 

I think my anxiety is causing me to develop a binge eating disorder, and I need advice from anyone who has potentially been through this. I have a therapist who is currently out on family leave, and I am not medicated and am trying to avoid medication because my husband is leaving his job (where I get my insurance) later this year and we're not quite sure what the insurance situation looks like after that so I'm really trying to avoid medication for now. 

After 8 years of no panic attacks, I had a massive panic attack 3 months ago. It has sent me into a spiral. It is an extremely stressful time for us, there are a lot of unknowns and I am stressed and highly anxious. We're talking daily anxiety attacks. 12 years ago when I started having panic attacks, I went to my primary care doctor (after this appointment I would change doctors) who told me there is no such thing as panic attacks, I had low blood sugar and needed to eat healthier. I did not have low blood sugar. I have never had blood sugar issues, I have a hormone condition that makes me prone to become diabetic so I get tested every year and my numbers are always perfect. But it weaved it's way into my brain and ever since, every single time I have an anxiety attack or a full blown panic attack alarm bells go off in my head and my brain screams that I have to eat. When I was having panic attacks a decade ago the eating wasn't that bad, this time around its bad bad. 

Ever since the panic attack, I've been spiraling. Daily anxiety attacks, sometimes two or three times a day, and alarm bells go off in my head and I don't calm down until I eat. I started testing my blood sugar, always numbers right where they need to be. My blood sugar is not low. But I cannot calm down until I eat something. Every single way I have of calming myself down from an anxiety attack, deep breaths, magnesium spray, lukewarm shower, a walk, the list goes on and I do not calm down until I eat something.

I know it is just there's a lot of moving things right now that are largely out of my control, and my brain is reaching for something it can control and creating a problem that does not exist that it can control and fix. I know I do not have blood sugar issues. But I cannot stop eating. I'm becoming agoraphobic again. I'm overeating, slowly gaining weight, I try to only reach for fruits/veggies/lean meats and complex carbs when this happens so at least if I'm going to overeat what I'm grabbing isn't junk but it's becoming a serious problem I don't have control of. 

I am mostly looking for advice, or if anyone has experienced this or something similar and what you do to get a grasp on it. It's exhausting. My grocery bill is climbing. I just don't know what to do. I had a 2 hour long anxiety attack today fighting the urge to eat and checked my blood sugar 6 times during it, each time it was exactly where it was supposed to be and I had eaten an hour before the anxiety attack started so I wasn't even hungry. 

TLDR; I am having anxiety attacks and my brain is telling me it's my blood sugar, but when I check my blood sugar it's at a good range and not low and I just eat anyway. I cannot calm the anxiety down without eating.

I spoke to my cardiologist and he said that my symptoms had nothing to do with the heart and to talk to a GI doctor. I waited for a while before I did that and it just so happens after my cardiologist told me my symptoms had nothing to do with my heart, my heartbeat got slower and I started getting chest tightness which is weird because I’ve never had it before so I started to panic.

1jtdhme,2025-04-07T05:01:00,Anxiety,"My anxiety feels invalid, but it’s competitive I have serious doubts about whether my anxiety is real or not. Technically, I have no formal diagnosis, but my mother and sister both do, (I have never been tested / gone to a dr.) and I’m aware of the genetic aspect of mental illness. My symptoms don’t seem to match precisely with what I read about online, but I definitely struggle with something. 

What I’m getting at here is basically: I don’t constantly feel anxious, when I am in a comfortable environment I have no malaise or feeling of impending doom, and I often don’t get physical symptoms (trouble breathing, chest pain, etc,.). On top of this, in school I was never identified as somebody with anxiety. Like, I was the shy, quiet kid, but I was still someone who got nominated to lead group projects, and speak for a group even though I really didn’t want to and was literally in tears just thinking about presenting. ALSO, my mother and sister’s anxiety presents completely different ranges of symptoms. In my case, it’s almost like it doesn’t exist, at least, I’m not aware of it working its magic. But suddenly, in a situation where I’m confronted with a stranger asking me questions, an authoritative figure, being alone in an unfamiliar place, or even just the tiniest bit out of my element, I get SO stressed so quickly that my heart starts pounding at a pace of a million beats a minute and maybe I burst into tears, and my face goes super red and hot. These little ‘attacks’ (not sure if they actually are anxiety attacks?) happen rarely, but they’re so inexplicable and severe and leave me reeling for day(s) after. For my sister, it’s like she’s always running on a battery sending in super inconsistent waves of nervous energy, but it’s always on. She also always gets these uncontrollable shivers and just radiates a feeling of unease that even strangers pick up on. My mother on the other hand, she usually gets very emotional and teary and close to shutting down completely, in fact, I’ve seen her basically bed-ridden because of it. 

In comparison to family, I feel like I have no valid exterior symptoms. As if all I am is just a little quiet, and not twisted up and freaking out inside. I remember once trying to speak to my mother about it and she gave me multivitamins. MULTIVITAMINS. Then, before I could even finish half the bottle, she gave them away to my sister because she needed them more, I guess? Anyways, it feels like nobody notices that something is seriously wrong, and I definitely know SOMETHING is wrong, but when I’m up against two people who definitely have anxiety and know what it’s like, and who also seem to dismiss whatever I feel because it isn’t exactly like their experience gives me very real doubts about my own.

In my head, I know that I’m broken and torn up inside, and whatever little shards of myself are there only exist to cut me up even more. I have NO friends, nobody I speak to regularly, I have no job, no drivers license. I am too cautious to go to university for fear that of confronting the friends I was not able to maintain relationships with; or facing the large crowds in classrooms of unfamiliar faces; or navigating a campus I don’t recognize.

1jtcf3y,2025-04-07T03:54:38,Anxiety,"Is this anxiety or something else? Bear with me here. I've been suffering for 9 months (since 2024 August) I need to know if this is anxiety or if my body is going haywire. If anyone is able to take the time to read this, thank you so much. I love you. I am about to write my entire story.

\----

I keep feeling there is something in my throat that feels like a finger poking inside, making want to gag or dry heave. When I breathe in, the air feels like that finger in my throat.

**How it started:**

This problem began in 2024. I started uni and was excited to go. I was a normal person. I ate in campus, I hung out with people etc. Around one day, I was really hungry, and was joining my class friend group for lunch.

I had a lot of food on my plate, ready to eat. I ate about two spoonful's until I felt oddly full. My appetite vanished and I looked at my food with unease. I don't have an eating disorder. I loved eating. But this was the first time I experienced it. I forced myself to eat as much as I can because I didn't want my peers to question why I couldn't finish my meal.

After that, I started taking a smaller portion of food. And even then, I had difficulty finishing them. It's like I get full way too easily.

**Second time:**

Before leaving my home to campus, I felt queasy for no reason. I told my mum and she said she had it too. My guess was probably from the food we ate. So it can't only be me. I drank a herbal tea and felt better to go to uni. But after that, I started to always feel a little queasy or no appetite. I go to campus without eating. I try to only eat there.

**Progressing worse: (End of first semester in uni)**

I always had a feeling in my throat like something (dry?) or something uncomfortable. But it never bothered me until I was travelling to campus one day for exam and I had to switch LRT. But instead of getting on the train, I walked towards the toilet because the feeling in my throat was so bad. I felt like to gag. I ended unexpectedly dry heaving. And I was so nervous. I had to distract myself on my phone by watching calming videos which slowly made me feel better.

I am scared of throwing up. I don't like hearing it, or seeing it or the word itself. And that experience shock me. I had no reason to dry heave. No warning. I wasn't ill. It just happened. I still managed to get to campus to take my exam and slowly felt better. I thought it was exam stress. No big deal right? well.

After that I went to a mall with a friend. We went to the food court to eat, but I didn't get anything. I felt like I was going to dry heave again from the smell and sight of food. After we left, I was fine (sort of)

**Home life:**

Every morning after breakfast I would feel that feeling in my throat like I might dry heave or actually throw up, so I would sit alone in my room every morning after breakfast for an hour to wait for it to pass. But slowly I have been improving out of no where. I can eat without feeling sick. I can eat a lot without feeling full quickly.

But the ""outside"" effects are still there. I do feel the throat feeling sometimes but it wasn't amplified.

**Restaurants:**

I can eat normally, but when I eat a little to much, the dry heaving sensation comes and I have to stop eating immediately and distract myself. Once I feel okay, I eat again. Hate the process tho. Makes me hate going out to eat with people or going out anywhere.

**Going out to nature areas:**

Nature is the main thing that calms me down. I go to the park to exercise and go hiking in the jungle. Sometimes the throat or gag feeling randomly comes. If it's anxiety, why in a place that calms me down? It still comes. Is something up with my body?

**Current situation.**

I had a 1 week break and felt completely fine. I'm eating again, throat feeling is minimal, sometimes I still get it especially when hiking. (still no clue) but quite manageable. But now I'm going back to uni and I felt fine at first. I'm eating breakfast and the dry heaving feeling is back.

I am worried sick. I'm missing out on a lot of classes because of how I had to wait at train stations while I feel sick before I feel ready to board them.

I stopped socializing, because the feeling is manageable when I am alone. I can't go to malls too either. It's horrid.

I avoid eating completely to go uni as it helps me from feeling really nauseous or wanting to dry heave, but it still happens. I can't keep this up either. It's not healthy at all! I go for 8 hours without eating and wouldn't feel hungry until I got home. I can't keep this up.

oh god, what do I do for class presentations? Can I tell my lecturer if I can record mine and send? I am really lost.

I started 10mg of Prozac back in July for just general anxiety concerns. Didn't have any negative experiences but, didn't really see any differences at all. Got bumped up to 20mg about 3.5 weeks ago.
